<h3>Privacy policy</h3>
<p>WOT Services Oy ("WOT") is endeavoured to protect the privacy of our users.

<p>When you download the Licensed Software for the first time WOT automatically creates for you a random (anonymous) identifier that will be used later to connect you with the requests from the Services. While using the Licensed Software it sends information about the identifier, the date and time of the request and the host name for each site you visit to WOT servers for identifying the visited web sites and retrieving their rating information. This information will be stored only temporarily and will be erased after a month.</p>

<p>Some parts of the Services, like the Portal, might require registration and you will be asked for some personal information (name, user name, email address and password). This information is collected only to help you to retain your previous Ratings in case like changing your computer, and the user name and the email address will be used only within the Portal. Your password is processed so that it cannot be recovered.
